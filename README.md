# Leischow Vang Individual Project

### Problem Statement
Students struggle to work in an organized and productively fashion. To solve this problem, this Java application will 
help students track their work and be productive with their time. The application will have the ability to create a task
list, utilize a timer to pace themselves. The application will have simple UI to lessen distractions. After studying, 
the application will record and display the work completed for the day. This will help students measure the amount of work 
they've completed in a span of time and understand how well they use their time working.
